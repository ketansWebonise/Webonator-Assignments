My Views about mongoDB:

Pros:
- Working with mongoDB provides with great amount of flexibility as there is no fixed structure of a collection.
- The attributes may have a complex structure, having fields representing any other entity rather than just attribute. So no need to make mapping tables/collections in many cases.
- Architechture designing is much more convenient as it do not limit us by dependency or reference issues.
- A wide range of functionalities given with nice and easy documentation available on internet.

Cons:
- Syntax is quite different from DBMSs previously dealt with. Mapping the analogy of many clauses is a bit difficult.
- complex search are a bit trickier as compared to SQL as inner query use is much simpler and well defined as compared to dealing with variables and aggregations in MongoDB.
